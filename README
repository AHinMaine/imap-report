    imap-report.pl - Generate reports on an imap account.

SCRIPT CATEGORIES

README
    Primarily intended for use with a gmail account, this script can
    generate various reports on an imap mailbox. I wrote this mostly out of
    frustration from google's lack of features to allow you to prune your
    mailbox.

    There is a crude caching mechanism present to speed things up after the
    message envelope information is loaded. Even though only header
    information is fetched and cached, this is still a very heavy, time
    consuming, memory hungry operation on a huge mailbox. The only operation
    that doesn't populate the cache automatically is the counting of all
    folders. All other report types end up needing to actually iterate
    messages and therefor populates the cache. Otherwise the count operation
    just uses the simple messages_count method of Mail::IMAPClient which
    uses the STATUS function of IMAP on an individual folder.

    All message fetch operations are broken up into small (--maxfetch)
    chunks so that if there is a problem during the fetch, such as getting
    disconnected or other imap error, it won't abort the whole operation,
    just the current chunk of messages being fetched.

SYNOPSIS
  OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
    --user *username*
                   Optional username for IMAP authentication. If omitted,
                   you will be prompted after running the script.

    --password *password*
                   Optional password for IMAP authentication. If omitted,
                   you will be prompted after running the script.

    --server *server hostname or ip*
                   The identity of the IMAP server.

                   (default: imap.gmail.com)

    --port *IMAP Port*
                   The port used to connect to the IMAP server.

                   (default: 993)

    --top *integer number*
                   The number of messages in top ten style reports.

                   (default: 10)

    --min *number of bytes*
                   Messages smaller than this size will be ignored when
                   gathering statistics on individual messages.

                   (default: 100000)

    --maxfetch *integer number*
                   The size of an individual fetch operation. Breaks a fetch
                   operation up into smaller chunks so that an individual
                   folder with a massive number of messages will not kill
                   the operation of there is a timeout or other
                   communication problem.

    --filters *string*
                   Folder filters. Restrict all operations to folders
                   matching the specified string. This option can be
                   specified multiple times.

    --exclude *string*
                   Folder exclusions. The list of folders will be pruned of
                   the ones matching the specified string. This option can
                   be specified multiple times. Perl compatible regex should
                   work as long as you take care not to allow your shell to
                   swallow up the expression.

    --cache *cache_filename*
                   Name of the file used to store cached information.

                   (default: $HOME/.imap-report.cache)

    --cache_age *integer*
                   Maximum age of cached information.

                   (currently non-functional)

                   (default: 1 day)

    --conf *config_filename*
                   Name of the file in which to read configuration options.

                   All of these configuration options can be stored in this
                   file using the same names listed here. Must only be
                   readable by the user.

                   (default: $HOME/.imapreportrc)

    --list         Just show the list of folders.

    --Keepalive    Corresponds to the Mail::IMAPClient Keepalive option.

                   (default: true)

    --Fast_io      Corresponds to the Mail::IMAPClient Fast_io option to
                   allow buffered I/O.

                   (default: true)

    --Ssl          Corresponds to the Mail::IMAPClient Ssl option.

                   (default: true)

    --debug        Lots of ugly debugging output to a logfile...

    --verbose      A bit more output than usual
